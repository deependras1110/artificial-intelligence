Evaluation Algorithm:

This evaluation algorithm is only applicable on children on 'min' nodes.

The following steps of the algorithm have been mentioned below:
#1 - To find the allowed Moves of the 'max' nodes
#2 - For each allowed move, we find the best move to win, loose as well as play based on probabilities.

        The algorithm is designed to find winning states for each move played.
        It also finds the states where the opposition could win. This is termed as loose states.
        A score for both win and loose is assigned and the best among them is selected.
        That is, if the win state is 2 on column 4 and loose state is 3 on column 6, 
            then loose state is chosen.
        
        As said, the algorithm also runs on probabilities and possibilities.
        The algorithm computes among the best moves, to see where the possibility of winning is more.
        That is, for an empty set like:

                                  1 2 3 4 5 6 7

                            F.    0 0 0 0 0 0 0
                            E.    0 0 0 0 0 0 0
                            D.    0 0 0 0 0 0 0
                            C.    0 0 0 0 0 0 0
                            B.    0 0 0 0 0 0 0
                            A.    0 0 0 0 0 0 0

                Here the current possible moves are A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, A6, A7

                To find the probabilities:
                    The algorithm could win on A1 only when 
                        1. A1, B1, C1 and D1 are computer
                        2. A1, A2, A3 and A4 are computer
                        3. A1, B2, C3 and D4 are computer
                    Thus A1 has a probability of 3.

                    Similarly to win on A2, there are:
                        1. A2, B2, C2 and D2 are computer
                        2. A1, A2, A3 and A4 are computer
                        2. A2, A3, A4 and A5 are computer
                        3. A1, B2, C3 and D4 are computer
                    Thus A2 has a possibilities of 4.

                For the current game state we get A4 to have maximum playing possibility that is 6.

        For all the moves, the possibilities are computed and the best is selected.

        If the program sees that there are no probabilities for any of the moves, 
        then a random move is played baseed on the available moves.
